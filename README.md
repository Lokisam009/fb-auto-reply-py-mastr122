# Credits
The main core of this project is the <b><a href = 'https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat'>fbchat</a></b> module. Without the module, it would be a very difficult task.
I just read their <a href = 'https://fbchat.readthedocs.io/en/master/'>doc</a> and copied their <a href = 'https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/tree/master/examples'>example code</a> and modified it for beginner users. ;-)
